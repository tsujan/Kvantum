"Kvantum.colors" is for KDE apps that may use KDE-specific colors.

Long story short, a KDE color scheme should be seen as a part of the user settings for the KDE style engine(s) but some KDE apps use it directly.

"Kvantum.colors" will be installed for the default Kvantum theme. There are also other color schemes, in 'themes/colors/', that will be installed to be used alongside the extra themes.
