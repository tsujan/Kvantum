V0.10.7
---------
 * Removed the workaround for Gwenview's scrollbar issue because it was potentially dangerous (actually, just in one case). Anyhow, Gwenview's bug was fixed a long time ago.
 * Cover a very rare case, where the special text of a spinbox is set when its value is minimum (which means a bad code).
 * Center menubar-item texts horizontally (they were left-aligned before).
 * Added a workaround for an old Qt bug which, sometimes, prevents updating of inactive widgets when the active and inactive highlight colors are the same.

V0.10.6
---------
 * Distinguish between a real tooltip and a window with the tooltip flag on unpolishing.
 * Fixed the minW key with line-edits.

 * Fixed the focus rectangles of tabbar scroll buttons.
 * No space between the tab contents and a nonexistent tabbar.
 * Added a hacking key (to Kvantum Manager) for the middle-click scroll jump (with the left-click jump as the default).
 * Handle the CMP0071 policy of CMAKE >= 3.10 (let AUTOMOC and AUTOUIC process GENERATED files).
 * Make combo_focus_rect use the normal panel to draw a combo box with the keyboard focus.
 * A workaround for a Qt5 mess in painting the "clear" button of line-edits (the issue is visible in Fusion too).
 * Remove "foreach" with Qt5.
 * Don't add the icon size to the size of check boxes or radio buttons when there's no icon.
 * Replaced QRegExp with QRegularExpression.
 * Support the global config files "$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/Kvantum/kvantum.kvconfig". (For distros.)
 * Fixed an old miscalculation in drawing tab labels.
 * Major enhancements and simplifications in the state change animation code through "QStyleOption::styleObject()". As a result, faulty animations are fixed and some missing animations are added, especially for all kinds of buttons.
 * Fixed the disabled text color of auto-raised toolbuttons in dark-and-light themes.
 * Don't draw the interior of the focus rectangle but allow complete focus elements on the whole widget (button like widgets, tabs, group boxes and sliders are supported), so that if their names exist in the config file, their elements will be drawn instead of the focus rectangle.
 * Don't rotate a rounded frame unless it has a top expanded (or border) element.
 * Added a key for an extra margin between tab frame and tab button.
 * Added a 3px spacing between the top text of a groupbox and its top frame.
 * Added optional icon/arrow separators for comboboxes in edit mode.

 * Put the texts of thin progressbars above them as far as possible. If there isn't enough space above a thin progressbar, put its the text in front of it.
 * Fixed inactive states of nonstandard buttons.
 * A workaround for badly designed progressbars (as in pavucontrol-qt -- I didn't fix pavucontrol-qt because other developers might make the same mistake).
 * Reverse the new default behavior of Qt5 submenus, due to which, submenus are closed when the cursor leaves all menus.
 * Handle disabled icons independently so that they're dim everywhere (even with KDE icon engine, which doesn't call generatedIconPixmap() with SVG symbolic icons).
 * Added a workaround for "selectable disabled view items" (Qt Creator can have such items with cmake projects).
 * Limit the menu check/redio box size to the small icon size and not to what QCommonStyle returns.
 * Added a key for bold active tab text.
 * Added a key for the degree of boldness (from 1 to 5; 3 means normally bold).
 * An optional "-tickless" element for the slider handle when the slider has no tick marks.
 * Optionally separate checkboxes in view-items.
 * Updated RTL header drawing because of a recent change (or issue?) in Qt5.
 * Standardized the color contrast calculation according to "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines".

V0.10.5
---------
 * Don't draw the groove of a transient scrollbar.

 * Ability to set frame expansion in terms of app font height (for total roundness to be independent of font size).
 * Ability to set active_tab_overlap in terms of app font height.
 * Suppressed GCC7 compilation warnings about "-Wimplicit-fallthrough=". (Red Hat again! Do they think people are stupid?)

 * Made the combo menu (popup as menu) exactly like a menu.
 * A key for removing checkboxes from combo menus.
 * Set the QObject property "menu_shadow", which is a QList<int> containing left, top, right and bottom menu shadow thicknesses in that order.
 * If needed, set the window text color of menus to the normal menuitem text color because some apps may do weird things with menus.
 * Added a key (to Kvantum manager) to reduce window translucency or set it in themes that don't have a translucent SVG backround for windows.
 * Added a key for "embedded" tabs, which are half embedded in their widgets.
 * Separated the Qt4 code from the Qt5 one.

 * Group tabbar scroll buttons together and remove their states.
 * Optionally separate titlebar buttons for dock widgets.
 * Make titlebars match the theme according to its lightness or darkness under GTK DEs like Gnome (by Craig Drummond). Now, the suffix "Dark" can have a practical meaning in the theme name.
 * Accept dark themes inside light theme directories.
 * Editable theme combobox in Kvantum Manager for finding installed themes by typing.
 * Put the progress text in front of the bar when "progressbar_thickness" is less than the text (font) height.

V0.10.4
---------

 * Workaround for Qt5 submenu timeout bug.
 * Don't draw normal states of flat default buttons.
 * A key is added (to Kvantum Manager) for not drawing window/dialog tiling patterns. As an example, an overlay pattern is added to KvCurves3d's translucent window and the key in question is used to disable it by default.
 * Added support for transient scrollbars :)
 * Don't make a window translucent if it has a stylesheet containing "background".
 * Really clean up in "unpolish(QApplication*)" (QupZilla's translucency problem is fixed by this).
 * Don't crash on wayland (preparation for wayland).
 * Handle floating frames as well as windows with the ToolTip flag.
 * No frame for flat groupboxes.
 * Always center tab text (also the text position is corrected, especially for RTL).
 * Added focus rectangle to all themes (also a variable is added for combo boxes without focus rectangle).
 * Update the small rectangles below attached tabs (when tab rectangles are moved by tab scroll buttons). This was needed because Kvantum attaches tabs to their tab widgets in a way different from (and better than) how other style engines do.
 * Added Arch PKGBUILD files (because Arch has the best way of making installable packages).

V0.10.3
---------
 * Choose the correct arrow for toolbar and menubar extension buttons. Unfortunately, the arrows can have no state other than normal and disabled (a Qt bug).

 * No interior and frame expansion when the label of a group box is drawn on its top frame.
 * Added support for expanded frame sizes.

---------
 * Deal with QML peculiarities.
 * Added support for separate checkboxes and radiobuttons on menus.

 * Set tab horizontal and vertical spaces according to tab frame thickness (which results in an appropriate space between close button and right frame).
 * Added an experimental hacking key for setting the icon size of LXQT's main menu when it isn't styled by LXQT.
 * Added "What's This?" to Kvantum Manager.
 * Added a workaround for a Qt5 bug (QTBUG-47043), because of which, _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE is set to _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL instead of _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DROPDOWN_MENU or _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_POPUP_MENU for QMenu.
 * Added a key for always centering tabs in the document mode.

 * Fixed tiny QStackedWidget arrows (in Qt4 Designer).

V0.2.1
---------
 * Added the possibility to have translucent menus or tooltips with compositing. Now they can also have rounded corners.

 * Added the possibility to attach the active tab to the tab widget.
 * Added decorative indicators to splitters.
 * Added grip indicators to scrollbar sliders.

 * Set SH_Menu_SloppySubMenus to true for being able to reach submenus by moving the cursor diagonally (bug #315346 at KDE Bugtracking System).
 * Don't remove tab bottom frames; users could remove them if they want to.
 * Fixed the transparency problem of scrollbars.
 * Fixed tabbar scroll buttons by adjusting PM_TabBar_ScrollButtonOverlap and PM_TabBarScrollButtonWidth.
 * Don't press a tool buttton if only its arrow is pressed.
 * A separate pressed or focused (hover) state for each spin button.
 * Treat arrows as icons for tool buttons.
 * Don't draw the interior of a Plasma spinbox.

 * Fixed Akregator's tabs.
 * Handled view-item texts inside buttons, like in Kate's font preferences.
 * Took care of vertical buttons in some apps (like digiKam) by not using sizeCalculated().
 * Other fixes.

V0.1
---------
 * Kvantum is born as a fork of QuantumStyle. Many bugs are fixed and some missing widgets are added so that it is fairly usable now but there is still a lot of work to do.
