*******************
*   Compilation   *
*******************
----------
IF YOU HAVE Arch OR ONE OF ITS DERIVATIVES, YOU COULD EASILY INSTALL Kvantum FROM ITS OFFICIAL REPOSITORY:

	sudo pacman -S kvantum-qt5

OR YOU COULD INSTALL THE LATEST git PACKAGE FROM THE Arch-User-Repository BY USING THE AUR HELPER OF YOUR CHOICE, FOR EXAMPLE:

	yaourt -S kvantum-qt5-git
----------

First install X11 and Qt development packages. In Debian-based systems, they are:

 * g++
 * libx11-dev and libxext-dev (for X11)
 * qtbase5-dev, libqt5svg5-dev and libqt5x11extras5-dev (for Qt5)
 * libqt4-dev (for Qt4 and if you want Qt4 support)
 * qttools5-dev-tools (for localization if you need it)

In Arch-based systems, the packages are:

 * gcc (or gcc-multilib for multilib systems)
 * libx11 and libxext (for X11)
 * qt5-base, qt5-svg and qt5-x11extras (for Qt5)
 * qt4 (for Qt4 and if you want Qt4 support)
 * qt5-tools (for localization if you need it)

In Red Hat based systems like Fedora:

 * gcc-c++
 * libX11-devel
 * libXext-devel
 * qt5-qtx11extras-devel
 * qt5-qtbase-devel
 * qt5-qtsvg-devel
 * qt5-qttools-devel

And, finally, in OpenSUSE:

 * gcc-c++
 * libX11-devel
 * libXext-devel
 * libqt5-qtx11extras-devel
 * libqt5-qtbase-devel
 * libqt5-qtsvg-devel
 * libqt5-qttools-devel

There are two ways to compile Kvantum: with qmake or with cmake.

With qmake
==========
Just open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following command:

	qmake && make

You might need to put the full path of qmake in the above command (especially for a second compilation against your non-default Qt installation). For example, in 64-bit Debian, it is /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/bin/qmake for Qt4 and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmake for Qt5.

With cmake
==========
Open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following commands for Qt5:

	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make

For Qt4, just add the option "-DENABLE_QT4=ON" to the cmake command in this way:

	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake .. -DENABLE_QT4=ON
	make

If you want to install Kvantum in a nonstandard path (which is not recommended), you could add the option "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=YOUR_SELECTED_PATH" to the cmake command.

********************
*   Installation   *
********************

Then, use this commands for installation:

	sudo make install

If you have compiled Kvantum with qmake, the following command cleans the source completely and makes it ready for another compilation (against another version of Qt, for example):

	make distclean

If you have used cmake for compilation, to compile Kvantum again, first remove the contents of the build directory.

Installation for your default Qt version (Qt5) is necessary but you could compile and install Kvantum twice, once for Qt5 and then for Qt4.

Kvantum Manager is based on Qt5 and cannot be compiled against Qt4.

The main reason for including a cmake build is that a few distros (especially Fedora) may have problem with qmake.

*************
*   Usage   *
*************

In KDE:
=======
(1) Select Kvantum from 'System Settings > Application Style > Widget Style' and apply it.

(2) Select Kvantum from 'System Settings > Color > Scheme' and click Apply. You could change the color scheme later if you choose another Kvantum theme with Kvantum Manager (see "Using Other Themes" below).

Logging out and in would be good for Plasma to see the new theme.

In LXQt:
========
Just select "kvantum" from Configuration Center > Widget Style. Kvantum Manager is also shown in Configuration Center for changing the Kvantum theme.

In case you use Compton as the X compositor, be sure to disable Compton's shadow and blurring for composited Qt menus with lines like these in '~/.config/compton.conf':

shadow-exclude = [ "argb && (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE@:a *= 'MENU' || _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE@:a *= 'COMBO')" ];
blur-background-exclude = [ "(_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE@:a *= 'MENU' || _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE@:a *= 'COMBO')" ];

In Other DEs and for Qt4:
=========================
Select Kvantum from 'qtconfig-qt4 > Appearance > Select GUI Style' and then, save the result with 'File > Save'.

In Other DEs and for Qt5:
=========================
Unfortunately, there is no qtconfig for Qt5. In environments that do not have a Qt5 configuration utility, you could use this command to run a Qt5 application APP:

	APP -style kvantum

Or, better, add this to your '~/.profile' or '~/.bashrc':

	export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum

If the display manager you use does not source '~/.profile', you could probably add the above line to '~/.xsessionrc'.

**************************
*   Using Other Themes   *
**************************

To select or install (as user) Kvantum themes, use "Kvantum Manager", which is already installed and is available in the start menu as a utility app. It explains each step in a straightforward way. With it, you could not only switch between themes easily but also select themes for specific applications.

For the running parts of KDE/LXQt to recognize the new Kvantum theme, the easiest way is logging out and in again.

*****************************
*   Notes for Theme Makers  *
*****************************

If the KDE color scheme of the theme is inside its folder, "Kvantum Manager" will install it too. So, theme makers might want to put these files in their theme folder: $THEME_NAME.svg, $THEME_NAME.kvconfig and $THEME_NAME.colors.

The contents of theme folders (if valid) can also be installed manually in the user's home. The possible installation paths are '~/.config/Kvantum/$THEME_NAME/', '~/.themes/$THEME_NAME/Kvantum/' and '~/.local/share/themes/$THEME_NAME/Kvantum/', each one of which takes priority over the next one, i.e. if a theme is installed in more than one path, only the instance with the highest priority will be used by Kvantum.

Themes can also be packaged as deb, rpm, xz,... packages and installed as root:
	(1) The possible root installation paths are '/usr/share/Kvantum/$THEME_NAME/' and '/usr/share/themes/$THEME_NAME/Kvantum/' (if PREFIX=/usr). The first path will take priority over the second one if a theme is installed in both.
	(2) The KDE color schemes should go to  '/usr/share/color-schemes/' for KF5 and '/usr/share/kde4/apps/color-schemes/' for KDE4.
	(3) If a theme is installed both as root and as user, the latter installation will take priority.

Please see "Theme-Making.pdf" for more information on theme installation paths and their priorities.

The default Qt5 installation adds several root themes, that can be selected by using Kvantum Manager. Their corresponding KDE color schemes and Openbox themes are also installed.

***********
*   GTK   *
***********

Kvantum does not -- and will not -- have any relation to GTK. However, it includes some themes similar to or matching GTK themes.
