A PDF version of this document is also included for easier reading.

The configuration of the default Kvantum theme can be easily copied by using Kvantum Manager (click Save button on its third page) or, manually and if the source of Kvantum is available, by following these steps:

(1) Create the folder "~/.config/Kvantum/" (~ is your home);

(2) Create the file "kvantum.kvconfig" in the above folder with this line in it:

theme=DefaultCopy

Here, DefaultCopy could be any name you choose for the new configuration;

(3) Create the folder "~/.config/Kvantum/DefaultCopy/" and the file "DefaultCopy.kvconfig" inside it;

(4) Copy/paste the contents of "style/themeconfig/default.kvconfig" (from the source) to "DefaultCopy.kvconfig".

Now, you can change the values of variables (keys). Please note that deleting a variable often means that its value will be taken from the default configuration, so that you could keep only those sections or variables you want to change. See below for a more accurate explanation.

There are many sections and variables in the config file. That's intentional: unlike most theme engines, Kvantum is supposed to be able to control virtually all aspects of widgets. Here are the meanings of various sections:

======================================================================
Section                                      Meaning
======================================================================
[%General]                                   General info on the theme and
                                             some general variables. ("%" IS
                                             REQUIRED because Qt uses [General]
                                             for another purpose.)

[GeneralColors]                              The most important colors used

                                             example, a push button.

[PanelButtonTool]                            Panel for a tool button.

[CheckBox]                                   A check box.

[Focus]                                      Generic focus frame/rectangle, drawn on a
                                             widget that has keyboard focus.

[GenericFrame]                               Generic frame. Mostly drawn around
                                             item/text views but some apps may draw
                                             it in other places too (see the key
                                             "remove_extra_frames" in General section).

[LineEdit]                                   A line edit (one-line text editor).


[DropDownButton]                             Indicator for a drop down button,
                                             for example, a tool button that
                                             displays a menu

[ToolboxTab]                                 Just text colors for tab labels of
                                             a toolbox.


[Tab]                                        The tab shape within a tab bar.
                                             Also the tear indicator of a
                                             tab bar and the close button
                                             of a tab.

[TabFrame]                                   The frame for tab widgets.

[TabBarFrame]                                The frame that is drawn for a
                                             tab bar, usually for a tab bar
                                             that isn't part of a tab widget.

[TreeExpander]                               Indicators used to represent the
                                             branch of a tree in a tree view.

[HeaderSection]                              A header section. Also its label
                                             and arrow.

[SizeGrip]                                   Window resize handle if it exists.

[Toolbar]                                    A toolbar. Also its handle and
                                             separator.

[ToolbarButton]                              Panel for a tool button on a stylable
                                             toolbar. This section is optional and
                                             can be omitted. If present, it will
                                             take all of its variables from
                                             PanelButtonTool, except for its text
                                             colors, text shadow, and (indicator,
                                             frame and interior) elements.

[ToolbarComboBox]                            Exactly like ToolbarButton but for
                                             combo boxes on stylable toolbars.

[ToolbarLineEdit]                            Panel for a line-edit on a stylable
                                             toolbar. This section is optional and
                                             can be omitted. If present, it will take
                                             all of its variables from LineEdit, except
                                             for its frame and interior elements.

                                             Also, note that the text color of such a
                                             line-edit is always the text color of the
                                             stylable toolbar behind it. Therefore,
                                             its interior (if any) should have a good
                                             contrast with that color.

[Scrollbar]                                  Scrollbar increase/decrease
                                             indicators (arrows).

[ScrollbarGroove]                            The groove of a scrollbar.

[ScrollbarSlider]                            A scrollbar slider.

[ScrollbarTransientSlider]                   An optional section for transient
                                             scrollbars (see "transient_scrollbar" below).
                                             It takes all of its values from
                                             "ScrollbarSlider", except for its frame and
                                             interior elements.

                                             It can also have its own frame sizes but if
                                             they don't exist, those of "ScrollbarSlider"
                                             will be used.

                                             It is useful when the ordinary scrollbar
                                             slider elements are not good enough with
                                             transient scrollbars.

[Slider]                                     A slider (a classic widget for
                                             controlling a bounded value).

[SliderCursor]                               The handle of a slider.

[Progressbar]                                The groove and label of a progressbar.

[ProgressbarContents]                        The progress indicator.

[ItemView]                                   An item in an item view.

[Splitter]                                   A splitter handle.

[Menu]                                       The panel and frame of a menu.
                                             Also its frame shadow.

[MenuItem]                                   A menu item in a menu. Also the
                                             tear-off section of a menu

[MenuBar]                                    The empty area of a menu bar.

[MenuBarItem]                                A menu bar item, like the buttons in
                                             a menubar.

[TitleBar]                                   A title bar, like those used in
                                             QMdiSubWindow.

[ComboBox]                                   A combo box and its label.

[GroupBox]                                   A group box and the frame around it.

[ToolTip]                                    The panel for a tooltip label.

[Window]                                     A window or dialog.

[WindowTranslucent]                          This is used when a distinction is
                                             needed to be made between (backgrounds
                                             of) opaque and translucent windows. If
                                             it is omitted, the above section will
                                             be used for all windows.

[Dialog]                                     This is used when a distinction is
                                             needed to be made between (backgrounds
                                             of) dialogs and windows. If it is
                                             omitted, the section "Window" will be
                                             used for both windows and dialogs.

                                             Here, "dialog" means any window without
                                             menubar and toolbar and not necessarily
                                             a QDialog.

[DialogTranslucent]                          Like "WindowTranslucent" but for dialogs.
======================================================================


The following table shows the variables (keys) you could change to configure the current theme — without necessarily making a new one — with the default values of some of them. These are the rules for the value inheritance:

(1) If a section (group) is not present in your configuration, its variables and their values will be taken from the default config file.

(2) If a variable is not present in a section of your configuration:
      (2a) First the "inherits" section will be searched for it and then, if nothing is found,
      (2b) its value will be taken from the same section of the default config file.

There are three exceptions to these rules:

Exception No.1: The "inherits" variable will not be taken from the default config file if it is not present in a section.

Exception No.2: If colors are omitted or not valid or if a section they could belong to is not present, they will be taken from the currently used color palette. Also font boldness/italicity will be ignored if omitted.

Exception No.3: Any variable related to compositing or hacking and also "frame.expandedElement" will be ignored if omitted.

                                                      button? By default, they are drawn on
                                                      adjacent buttons.

inline_spin_separator             true/false          If the spin box has separator SVG
                                                      elements, they will be drawn between
                                                      its line-edit and horizontal buttons
                                                      (See "Theme-Making.pdf"). However, if
                                                      this key is true, the separator will
                                                      also be drawn when there is no button,
                                                      i.e. when "inline_spin_indicators" is
                                                      true.

                                                      Usually, "inline_spin_indicators" is
                                                      set to true to integrate the indicators
                                                      into the line-edit and so, the default
                                                      value of this key is false.

vertical_spin_indicators          true/false          Draw spin indicators vertically and
                                                      inside the spin line-edit? By default,
                                                      they are drawn on adjacent buttons.

                                                      Note: If this key is set to true, the
                                                      keys "inline_spin_indicators" and
                                                      "inline_spin_separator" will have no
                                                      effect.

spin_button_width                 Integer             The width of horizontal spin buttons.
                                                      It is 16px by default and is always
                                                      between 16 and 32px.

combo_as_lineedit                 true/false          Draw an editable combo box as a
                                                      line-edit with an arrow (and an icon
                                                      if any)? By default, editable combo
                                                      boxes consist of combo, line-edit and
                                                      drop down elements.

combo_menu                        true/false          Should the popup of combo boxes be
                                                      styled as per popup menus (i.e. like
                                                      Gtk)? By default, they are shown below
                                                      the combo box.

combo_focus_rect                  true/false          Should combo boxes have focus rectangles?
                                                      The default is false because combo boxes
                                                      are drawn by the "pressed" SVG elements
                                                      when they have the keyboard focus but, if
                                                      set to true, this key draws them with the
                                                      "normal" SVG elements and adds a focus
                                                      rectangle to them in that state. (The
                                                      focus rectangle is defined under the
                                                      "Focus" section.)

square_combo_button               true/false          Should the combo arrow buttons be square
                                                      as far as possible? The default is false
                                                      but if this key has a true value, editable
                                                      combo boxes will be drawn as line-edits
                                                      attached to square arrow buttons.

                                                      Note that this key will have no effect if
                                                      "combo_as_lineedit" is true because, in
                                                      that case, the whole editable combo box
                                                      will be drawn as a line-edit.

left_tabs                         true/false          Align normal tabs to the left edge.
                                                      Tabs are centered by default.

center_doc_tabs                   true/false          Center tabs if the tab widget is
                                                      in the document mode. False by default.

attach_active_tab                 true/false          Attach the active tab to the tab widget
                                                      or the tab-bar base? It is detached
                                                      by default.

embedded_tabs                     true/false          If "attach_active_tab" is false, should
                                                      tabs be half embedded in their widgets
                                                      (provided that it is not in the document
                                                      mode)? This is false by default.

joined_inactive_tabs              true/false          Join inactive tabs together? They are
                                                      joined by default. Also, see
                                                      "Theme-Making.pdf" for tab separators.

mirror_doc_tabs                   true/false          By default, bottom and right tab shapes
                                                      are mirror images of top and left ones,
                                                      respectively. Setting this key to false
                                                      will change that behavior if the tab
                                                      widget is in the document mode or if
                                                      the active tab is detached (i.e. the
                                                      value of the key "attach_active_tab"
                                                      is false), so that the top/left and
                                                      bottom/right tab shapes will be identical.
                                                      The default value is true.

no_active_tab_separator           true/false          Do not draw tab separator for the active
                                                      tab? False by default, which means that,
                                                      if tab separators exist in the SVG image,
                                                      they will be drawn for all tabs.

                                                      See "Theme-Making.pdf" for an explanation
                                                      of tab separators.

active_tab_overlap                Integer             Number of pixels inactive tabs overlap
                                  or                  the active one. It is zero by default.
                                  DECIMALfont         The active tab is drawn in front of its
                                                      adjacent inactive tabs when the value of
                                                      this key is positive.

                                                      It is safe to set a great value here.

                                                      The string "font" can be appended to the
                                                      value (without quotes and space), in
                                                      which case, the value will be multiplied
                                                      by the height of the app font (in px) and
                                                      could also be a decimal (as in
                                                      "active_tab_overlap=2.5font").

no_inactive_tab_expansion         true/false          If tabs have frame expansion, setting
                                                      this key to true will disable frame
                                                      expansion for inactive tabs.

tab_button_extra_margin           Integer             The extra margin between the tab frame and
                                                      tab buttons (the close button, for example).
                                                      It is zero by default and its maximum is
                                                      the font height (because some apps may not
                                                      respect a greater value). Note that there is
                                                      a default minimum margin without this key.

                                                      The string "font" can be appended to the
                                                      value (without quotes and space), in
                                                      which case, the value will be multiplied
                                                      by the height of the app font (in px)
                                                      and could also be a decimal (as in
                                                      "tab_button_extra_margin=0.25font").

bold_active_tab                   true/false          Should the active tab text be bold? By
                                                      default, the active tab text is like the
                                                      inactive one.

group_toolbar_buttons             true/false          Raise and group neighbor toolbar buttons?
                                                      By default, they are not raised.

toolbar_item_spacing              Integer             The space between toolbar buttons. Zero
                                                      by default. It is also zero if the key
                                                      group_toolbar_buttons is set to true.

toolbar_interior_spacing          Integer             The space around the interior of toolbars.
                                                      Zero by default.

toolbar_separator_thickness       Integer             The thickness of toolbar separators. It is
                                                      never less than the toolbar indicator size
                                                      or 4, whichever is greater.

center_toolbar_handle             true/false          If "true", the SVG element for the
                                                      toolbar handle will be centered
                                                      and its size will be that of the
                                                      toolbar indicator. Otherwise, it
                                                      will be scaled vertically with an
                                                      8-px width. False by default.

slim_toolbars                     true/false          When true, the size of toolbar
                                                      icons will be 16px if it is not
                                                      set in the app. If false, the size
                                                      will be determined by the DE or
                                                      the app. False by default.

                                                      Note: "toolbar_icon_size" will take
                                                      priority over this key if existing
                                                      (see below).

toolbutton_style                  Integer             Sets the toolbutton style when it
                                                      is not set by the app. 0: follow,

                                                      3: text beside icon, and
                                                      4: text under icon. The toolbutton
                                                      style is 0 by default.

dialog_button_layout              Integer             The layout of dialog buttons. 0: follow,
                                                      1: KDE layout, 2: Gnome layout,
                                                      3: Mac layout, 4: Windows layout, and
                                                      5: Android layout. The default is 0.

spread_progressbar                true/false          Spread the progressbar's indicator
                                                      across its whole groove and not
                                                      just its interior? By default,
                                                      the indicator is drawn inside
                                                      progressbar's frame.

progressbar_thickness             Integer             If positive, it sets the (maximum)
                                  or                  progressbar thickness as far as
                                  DECIMALfont         possible. It is zero by default,
                                                      which means there is no limit to
                                                      progressbar thickness.

                                                      Note 1: If it is positive but less
                                                      than the height of the progressbar
                                                      text, the text will be put above the
                                                      bar or, when there is not enough space
                                                      above the bar, in front of it.

                                                      Note 2: The string "font" can be appended
                                                      to the value (without quotes and space),
                                                      in which case, the value will be
                                                      multiplied by the height of the app font
                                                      (in px) and could also be a decimal (as
                                                      in "progressbar_thickness=2.5font").

spread_header                     true/false          Spread the header's interior so that it
                                                      meets the frame of its view as far as
                                                      possible (good for drawing simple
                                                      headers). Its value is false by default
                                                      but if you set it to true, do not
                                                      remove top, right or left header frames
                                                      because they may be needed when the
                                                      header is RTL vertical or not stretched.

                                                      It is enabled by default.

merge_menubar_with_toolbar        true/false          Draw adjacent menu and tool bars
                                                      as a whole? If "true", the toolbar
                                                      SVG interior and frame will be used
                                                      for drawing them.

spread_menuitems                  true/false          By default, menu-items are drawn inside
                                                      the frames of their menu. This key
                                                      spreads them horizontally, so that they
                                                      cover the left and right frames of the
                                                      menu but not its shadow.

composite                         true/false          Use compositing to have
                                                      translucent menus or tooltips?
                                                      It is automatically set to false
                                                      if no compositing is available.
                                                      Its absence also means false.

scrollable_menu                   true/false          Should big menus be scrollable and
                                                      have scroll arrows on their top and/or
                                                      bottom? True by default. With a false
                                                      value, all menu-items are shown.

                                                      submenu and its parent menu. The
                                                      default is 0. It cannot be greater than
                                                      16px.

translucent_windows               true/false          Translucent windows and dialogs?
                                                      This requires a translucent SVG
                                                      element for windows or a positive value
                                                      for "reduce_window_opacity". A false
                                                      value, its absence or a false value for
                                                      "composite" means no translucency.

                                                      Window translucency is also disabled
                                                      automatically when there is neither a

                                                      false for them and, at the same time,
                                                      "reduce_window_opacity" is zero.

reduce_window_opacity             Integer             If "translucent_windows" is set to true,
                                                      this key will reduce the window opacity
                                                      by the percentage of its value regardless
                                                      of whether a translucent element for
                                                      window background exists in the SVG image
                                                      or not. The default value is 0 and the
                                                      maximum is 90.

reduce_menu_opacity               Integer             As above but for menus.

opaque                            String list         A comma-separated list of
                                                      executables, whose apps should not
                                                      have window translucency. It has
                                                      meaning only if translucent_windows
                                                      is set to true.

blurring                          true/false          Blur the screen area behind windows that
                                                      are made translucent by Kvantum? This
                                                      needs KDE blur effect and also a graphic
                                                      card that supports it. It has no effect
                                                      when "composite" or "translucent_windows"
                                                      is false.

popup_blurring                    true/false          Blur the regions behind menus and
                                                      tooltips that are made translucent by
                                                      Kvantum? This needs KDE blur effect and
                                                      a graphic card that supports it. It will
                                                      automatically be set to true if
                                                      "blurring" is true.

shadowless_popup                  true/false          Should the shadows that Kvantum adds
                                                      to menus and tooltips with compositing
                                                      be removed?

                                                      May be useful under a DE that gives
                                                      shadow to tooltips and menus.

                                                      although the presence of the (KDE) blur
                                                      effect is not needed. Their default value
                                                      is 1 and they are always between 0 and 2.

animate_states                    true/false          Animate the state change in some
                                                      widgets, especially when they are under

                                                      color for text entry widgets. It
                                                      should not have a high contrast
                                                      with "window.color".

                                                      color in views with alternating
                                                      row colors. It should not have a
                                                      high contrast with "base.color".

                                                      If it has translucency, it will be
                                                      applied over "base.color".

                                                      (usually, the same as "window.color").

light.color                       String (#RRGGBBAA)  Lighter than "button.color". It
                                                      is used in 3D bevels and also in
                                                      drawing toolbox tabs.

                                                      "dark.color". It is the color of
                                                      table grid lines but is also used
                                                      in drawing toolbox tabs.

shadow.color                      String (#RRGGBBAA)  A very dark color. By default,
                                                      it is black (can be ignored).

                                                      "base.color".

inactive.text.color               String (#RRGGBBAA)  The inactive foreground color used
                                                      with "base.color". It falls back to
                                                      "text.color" if missing.

                                                      inactive windows. It falls back
                                                      to "window.text.color" if missing.

                                                      indicator. Useful when the progress
                                                      text does not have enough contrast
                                                      with the progress indicator.

frame                             true/false          Draw a frame around the widget?

frame.top
frame.bottom
frame.left
frame.right                       Integer             The height or width of the corresponding
                                                      frame part if there is any.

                                                      These values are mostly respected but
                                                      there are two exceptions: (1) Where there
                                                      is not enough space (because of a bad GUI
                                                      design); and (2) A few widgets may not
                                                      accept the exact values — for example,
                                                      toolbars use the maximum value in all
                                                      directions.

frame.expanded.top
frame.expanded.bottom
frame.expanded.left
frame.expanded.right              Integer             When a frame expansion is done with both
                                                      "expand-" and "border-" SVG elements (see

                                                      Border"), the drawn border serves as a
                                                      kind of frame. Then, these keys determine
                                                      the thicknesses of its corresponding parts.

                                                      If they are set to zero, missing or
                                                      greater than their corresponding ordinary
                                                      frame sizes, the ordinary frame sizes
                                                      will be used for the thickness of the
                                                      expanded border.

frame.expansion                   Integer             A positive value (in px) will expand the
                                  or                  frames until the corner frames meet
                                  DECIMALfont         each other either vertically or
                                                      horizontally, provided that at least
                                                      the height or the width of the widget
                                                      is not greater than it. With appropriate
                                                      SVG images, this key can be used for
                                                      making corners completely rounded. Its
                                                      value is zero by default. Read the file

                                                      The string "font" can be appended to the
                                                      value (without quotes and space), in
                                                      which case, the value will be multiplied
                                                      by the height of the app font (in px) and
                                                      could also be a decimal (as in
                                                      "frame.expansion=2.8font").

frame.patternsize                 Integer             The frame pattern size. Used for tiling
                                                      the frame of a widget with a pattern. A
                                                      value of zero means no pattern (default).
                                                      Mostly useful for making dotted frames.

focusRectElement                 string               If present, to draw the generic focus
                                                      rectangle of the current widget, this
                                                      element will be used instead of the
                                                      frame element of the Focus section.

                                                      Some widgets may need separate elements
                                                      for their generic focus rectangles
                                                      because of their background colors. If
                                                      so, this key can be used. It has effect
                                                      for button like widgets, tabs, group
                                                      boxes and sliders. All other parameters
                                                      will be taken from the Focus section.

focusFrame                       true/false           Draw a focus frame when the widget has
                                                      the keyboard focus? This replaces the
                                                      generic focus frame/rectangle (see Focus
                                                      section) for button like widgets, tabs,
                                                      group boxes and sliders. If it is true,
                                                      the element name that is used for drawing
                                                      the focus frame will be "frame.element"
                                                      (see below) plus the string "-focus". All
                                                      sizes will be those of the usual frame.

                                                      This key will be ignored if there is no
                                                      frame and is false by default. Also, note
                                                      that a focus frame can be expanded like
                                                      an ordinary frame when "frame.expansion"
                                                      is positive.

interior                          true/false          Draw an interior for the widget?

interior.x.patternsize
interior.y.patternsize            Integer             The interior pattern sizes. Used for
                                                      tiling the interior of a widget with
                                                      a pattern. A value of zero means no
                                                      tiling in the corresponding direction.
                                                      Their absence also means no pattern.
                                                      Some widget types may never accept
                                                      patterns.

focusInterior                     true/false          Draw a focus interior when the widget
                                                      has the keyboard focus? If it is true,
                                                      the element name that is used for
                                                      drawing the focus interior will be
                                                      "interior.element" (see below) plus
                                                      the string "-focus".

                                                      This key will be ignored if "focusFrame"
                                                      is false or there is no interior or frame
                                                      and is false by default.

indicator.size                    Integer             Some widgets, like scrollbar arrows,
                                                      have indicators. This is their size.

text.margin                       true/false          Put a margin around the text
                                                      for widgets that have text?

text.margin.top
text.margin.bottom
text.margin.left
text.margin.right                 Integer             The sizes of the text margins if any.

                                                      These values are mostly respected but
                                                      not if there is a lack of space because
                                                      of a bad GUI design.

                                                      Also, in widgets like LineEdit, where
                                                      texts are not drawn by Kvantum, the real
                                                      left/right text margins may be a little
                                                      greater than text.margin.left/right. In
                                                      ItemView, the maximum margin is 6.

                                                      Note: For historical reasons, Kvantum draws
                                                      button like widgets a little more compact
                                                      by subtracting one pixel from their text
                                                      margins.

text.normal.color                 String (#RRGGBBAA)  The color of the normal text as
                                                      #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA or with a valid
                                                      name like white, black, red, etc. It may
                                                      override the text colors defined under
                                                      the section "GeneralColors".

                                                      Note 1: "MenuBarItem" always gets its normal
                                                      text color from the "MenuBar" section or, if
                                                      menubar and toolbar are merged (see the key
                                                      "merge_menubar_with_toolbar"), from the
                                                      "Toolbar" section.

                                                      Note 2: State-specific text colors do not
                                                      have meaning for Window, Dialog, Dock,
                                                      LineEdit and frame widgets (namely
                                                      GenericFrame, TabFrame and TabBarFrame).
                                                      In the case of LineEdit, the text color is
                                                      "text.color".

text.focus.color                  String (#RRGGBBAA)  The color of the focused/hover text.

                                                      Note: For "MenuBarItem", it serves as a
                                                      fallback color in case the press or toggle
                                                      text colors are not set.

text.press.color                  String (#RRGGBBAA)  The color of the pressed text.

text.toggle.color                 String (#RRGGBBAA)  The color of the toggled text.

text.normal.inactive.color
text.focus.inactive.color
text.press.inactive.color
text.toggle.inactive.color        String (#RRGGBBAA)  These keys are for text colors of inactive
                                                      widgets and fall back to their
                                                      corresponding ordinary keys if missing.

                                                      NOTE: Except for button like widgets and,
                                                      probably, view items, the normal and
                                                      inactive colors should not have high
                                                      contrast with each other.

text.bold                         true/false          Bold font for text? The font
                                                      is not bold by default.

                                                      Note: For technical reasons, texts of combo
                                                      boxes, menu-items and view items are not made
                                                      bold by Kvantum.

text.boldness                     Integer             The weight of bold texts (if any). Its value
                                                      is from 1 to 5, with 3 (normally bold) as
                                                      default.

                                                      Note that some fonts may have only one
                                                      degree of boldness.

text.italic                       true/false          Italic font for text? The font
                                                      is not italic by default.

                                                      Note: For technical reasons, texts of combo
                                                      boxes, menu-items and view items are not made
                                                      italic by Kvantum.

text.shadow                       true/false          Draw a shadow for the text?

text.shadow.xshift
text.shadow.yshift                Integer             The vertical/horizontal shifts of the
                                                      text shadow if it exists.

text.shadow.color                 String (#RRGGBBAA)  The color of the text shadow as #RRGGBB or
                                                      #RRGGBBAA or with a valid name like white,
                                                      black, red, etc.

                                                      It should have enough contrast with the
                                                      text color; otherwise, it won't be drawn;
                                                      e.g., black texts can't have black shadows.

text.inactive.shadow.color        String (#RRGGBBAA)  Like "text.shadow.color" and falling back
                                                      to it if missing but for inactive widgets.

text.shadow.alpha                 Integer (0-255)     The opacity of the text shadow. 255
                                                      means completely opaque. If the alpha
                                                      is set in #RRGGBBAA as the shadow color
                                                      name, this key can be left to 255 (its
                                                      default value).

text.shadow.depth                 Integer             The text shadow depth.

                                                      NOTE: For technical reasons, depths > 1
                                                      are considered as 1. It is kept until Qt
                                                      supports a better way of adding text shadows
                                                      by using its painter.

min_width
min_height                        Integer             Minimum width or height (in px). They
                                  or                  have meaning only for menuitems, menubar

                                                      view items (only the height).

                                                      They can also be used under Window and
                                                      Dialog sections (and their translucent
                                                      counterparts), in which case, they mean
                                                      the minimum width/height of the drawn
                                                      background (interior) SVG element,
                                                      so that if the widget's width/height
                                                      is smaller, the background will be cut
                                                      from right/bottom. This can be useful
                                                      with gradients.

                                                      The string "font" can be appended to the
                                                      value (without quotes and space), in
                                                      which case, the value will be multiplied
                                                      by the height of the app font (in px)
                                                      and could also be a decimal (as in
                                                      "min_height=2.3font").

                                                      If "+" is prepended to the value (without
                                                      quotes and space), the value will be
                                                      added to the width/height of the widget,
                                                      instead of being considered as the
                                                      minimum. For example, "min_width=+0.5font"
                                                      adds half the font height to the widget
                                                      width. Please do not mistake "+" for a
                                                      positive value here; the values are
                                                      always considered to be nonnegative.

                                                      NOTE: For combo boxes and line-edits, when "+"
                                                      is used with min_width, the horizontal
                                                      text margins are also increased.

If you want to make your own theme (see the file "Theme-Making"), you'll also need to know the meanings of these variables:


======================================================================
Variable                       Value                 Meaning
======================================================================
interior.element               String                The SVG element to be used for
                                                     drawing the interior of a widget.

frame.element                  String                The SVG element to be used for
                                                     drawing the frame of a widget.

frame.expandedElement          String                The optional SVG element to be used
                                                     only for drawing the expanded frame.
                                                     If not present, "frame.element"
                                                     will be used for expanded frames too.
                                                     See "frame.expansion"!

indicator.element              String                The SVG element to be used for
                                                     drawing the indicator of a widget.

Application Themes
==================
Specific Themes can be assigned to applications, so that those applications use their corresponding themes instead of the active theme. This can be done easily by using the last page of Kvantum Manager (Application Themes) or manually, by adding app lists (executable names) to '~/.config/Kvantum/kvantum.kvconfig' with the following format:

[General]
theme=ACTIVE_THEME

[Applications]
THEME1=app1, app2
THEME2=app3
...


Some Examples
=============

If you don’t want menus and tooltips to be translucent or cast shadow and want the current color palette to be used for all texts, you could use a blank configuration or a very basic one with just this in it:

[%General]

You could also be more explicit:

[%General]
composite=false

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=none
text.focus.color=none
text.press.color=none
text.toggle.color=none

Here "none" is not a valid color, so text colors will be taken from the currently used color palette.

If you want to have bigger buttons without increasing your font sizes, you could use this:

[%General]
composite=true
menu_shadow_depth=6
tooltip_shadow_depth=6

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=white
text.focus.color=#80C0FF
text.press.color=#white
text.toggle.color=#white
text.margin.top=4
text.margin.bottom=4
text.margin.left=5
text.margin.right=5

[PanelButtonTool]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

To have black text shadows with light green focused text, use this (black text shadows are already defined but disabled in the default config file):

[%General]
composite=true
menu_shadow_depth=6
tooltip_shadow_depth=6

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=white
text.focus.color=lightgreen
text.press.color=white
text.toggle.color=white
text.shadow=true

Note that, in the two examples above, the compositing values and normal/focused text colors are also added because otherwise, they would be disabled (see the exceptions above). In the previous example, customized text colors were disabled for all widgets other than push-buttons because there were no sections for them. If you want them back, you could add sections like these:

[PanelButtonTool]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

[Tab]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

[MenuItem]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

And so on.
